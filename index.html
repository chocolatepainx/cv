        <p><em>Founder and CEO of <strong>Stay Ahead</strong></em></p>
        <p>
          Introducing Stay Ahead, a way to focus on the journey and not the
          destination. I started this company to be able to guide people
          in the right direction. If you're lost and not sure what to do
          next, I can work with you to build a plan on getting back on
          track!
        </p>

          I'm proud of the impact that I've had.
          I'm a Recruiter with an engineering heart. I love the blend
          between "People and Tech". During the day I'm a full-time Recruiter,
          at night I'm a developer. When I'm busy building things that make me happy,
          I'm constantly pushed to learn new things. I take these learnings to the
          team and implement best practices for hiring.

          For me a great technical recruiter should be able to understand the logic
          behind development, not be confused in a technical debrief, or to provide
          technical feedback. This allow deeper relationships with candidates
          and providing technical feedback for improving their skills.

          I'm looking to be the best tech recruiter, providing the solution on
          how to crush technical interviews...Well that's the goal at least.
